Some notes:

- There are no working links as of now off of the projects page

- Feel free to use this as a template. It uses basic boostrap and is pretty easy to look through

- The code base for this site was modeled from a friends project named: SphyperMedia
github: https://github.com/thehellahub/SphyperMedia

- If you wish to visit the webpage go to deployments on the github repo or visit:
  https://code-c.github.io/

There is nothing special going on yet. My plans include looking into:
 - Creating an interactive demo for the game fernQuest
 - An AI chat bot maybe... it may not work on a static webpage
 - I may convert this to a React front end in another repo
